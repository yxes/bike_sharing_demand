You may need to install the perl module:

Date::Calc

to run this script.

the simplest way to do so is use the command:

perl -MCPAN -e shell

at the CPAN prompt type:

install Date::Calc

when it's complete just type

quit

to exit and then run the script -- it
should make it's predictions fairly fast.
